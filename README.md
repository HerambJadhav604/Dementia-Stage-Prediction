# **Predicting Dementia Stages Using MRI Scans**
### A Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Approaches with ResNet50 and DenseNet121

## **Project Overview**
This project explores deep learning techniques for classifying different stages of dementia using MRI scans. The study compares the performance of **ResNet50** and **DenseNet121** in detecting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) stages. The goal is to enhance early detection and improve diagnostic accuracy using **computer vision and deep learning techniques**.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this study is sourced from the **Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)**, which contains MRI scans categorized into four dementia stages:
- **Non-Demented**
- **Very Mild Demented**
- **Mild Demented**
- **Moderate Demented**

### **Preprocessing Steps**
- Images were resized to **224x224 pixels** for input to CNN architectures.
- Data augmentation techniques were applied to improve model generalization.
- Class imbalance was addressed using oversampling to enhance model training.

## **Models Used**
- **Baseline CNN Model**: Developed as a reference for benchmarking performance.
- **ResNet50**: Achieved **92.29% accuracy**, performing well in feature extraction.
- **DenseNet121**: Achieved **90.32% accuracy**, showing competitive performance.
